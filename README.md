# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.

The example has been enhanced to run on IBM Bluemix. Just click on the button
below to deploy the app directly on Bluemix. It also creates an instance of Active Deploy, your one-stop-shop for zero-downtime deployments.
